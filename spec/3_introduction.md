## Introduction

This section is non-normative.

The Trustchain is a blockchain system that was designed from the ground to deal with use cases in the self-sovereign identity context. It combines the advantages of a classical hierarchical public key infrastructure and the Web of Trust's decentralized approach.

Since the goal of the Trustchain blockchain is to offer multiple networks, the DID method is designed to connect every hosted Trustchain network with each other, if wished. This allows cross network references so DIDs from another network can smoothly interact with each other.
